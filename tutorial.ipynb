    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "curl http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings \\\n",

    "### 🧠 Model Highlights\n",
    "- **Context Length:** Supports up to 8192 tokens, accommodating long documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:** Outperforms models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 on benchmarks such as MTEB and LoCo .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source:** Fully open weights, training data, and code, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.\n",
